        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Guinness beef stew is a very simple dish, but at the same time, it has a deep, complex, rich flavor. The maltiness of dark beer really does amazing things for the gravy. I served this in a nice ring of green onion-mashed potatoes. I hope you give this a try, whether for Saint Patrick's Day or any time of the year.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bacon: This Guinness stew starts with bacon. You'll use the bacon and the bacon fat to cook the beef.</li>
            <li>Beef: Cut your boneless beef chuck into 2-inch pieces.</li>
            <li>Seasonings and herbs: This flavorful beef stew is seasoned with salt, black pepper, fresh garlic, white sugar, and fresh thyme.</li>
            <li>Beer: Of course, you'll need a can of dark beer (such as Guinness).</li>
            <li>Vegetables: This chunky Guinness stew features onions, carrots, and celery.</li>
            <li>Tomato paste: Tomato paste adds richness and flavor depth.</li>
            <li>Stock: Use store-bought or homemade broth. You can use chicken or beef stock.</li>
            <li>Mashed potatoes: Mashed potatoes are optional, but they make a great bed for the Guinness stew. Try our top-rated Basic Mashed Potatoes recipe.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
