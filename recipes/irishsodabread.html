        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Irish soda bread made with buttermilk and basic pantry ingredients. The buttermilk gives this crusty loaf a good flavor. It's the best Irish soda bread around!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour: This classic Irish soda bread starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li>Margarine: Margarine has a higher water content than butter, so the results are often softer. If you want, you can substitute Irish butter.</li>
            <li>Sugar: Four tablespoons of sugar add the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
            <li>Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the bread rise.</li>
            <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the Irish soda bread.</li>
            <li>Buttermilk: A cup of buttermilk adds flavor and helps the loaf rise even higher.</li>
            <li>Egg: An egg lends richness and flavor. Plus, it helps bind the dough together.</li>
            <li>Butter: Brush the unbaked loaf with a mixture of buttermilk and butter before you bake it for extra flavor and shine.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the first six ingredients in a bowl. Stir in the buttermilk and egg.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out and knead. Form the dough into a round loaf.</li>
            <li>Brush with butter and buttermilk, then cut an X in the top.</li>
            <li>Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        </ol>
